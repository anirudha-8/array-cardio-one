# Array Cardio Day 1 💪

Welcome to **Array Cardio Day 1**! This repository contains a JavaScript workout focusing on manipulating arrays using powerful built-in methods like `filter()`, `map()`, `sort()`, and `reduce()`. Let's get those JavaScript muscles working! 🧠💻

## 📝 About This Project

This project helps you practice key JavaScript array methods. Below is a brief overview of the tasks you will find in the code:

1. **Filter**: Filter inventors born in the 1500s. 🔎

2. **Map**: Extract full names from an array of inventors. 📇

3. **Sort**: Sort inventors by birth year (oldest to youngest). 📅

4. **Reduce**: Calculate the total years lived by all inventors. 🧮

5. **Sort (by years lived)**: Rank inventors by their lifespan. 👵🧓

6. **Sort (alphabetically)**: Organize a list of people by last name. 📂

7. **Reduce (instances)**: Count different modes of transportation. 🚗🚲🚶

## 📚 Topics Covered

- `Array.prototype.filter()` 🌿

- `Array.prototype.map()` 🗺️

- `Array.prototype.sort()` 🔀

- `Array.prototype.reduce()` ➗

## 💻 How to Run the Code

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/array-cardio-one.git
    ```

2. Open the project folder and load `index.html` in your browser. Open the browser's **Console** (F12 or right-click and select **Inspect** > **Console**) to see the array method outputs.

## Feel free to fork this repo and experiment! Let's continue strengthening those JavaScript skills! 💪
